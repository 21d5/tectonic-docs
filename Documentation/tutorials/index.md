# Welcome to the Tectonic tutorials!

Thank you for your interest in CoreOS Tectonic. We hope you’re excited to learn how Tectonic works and how enterprise-ready Kubernetes can improve your organization’s application infrastructure.

To help you get up and running with Tectonic, we have designed these step-by-step tutorials:
* [Tectonic and Kubernetes][kubernetes-tutorials] demonstrates how to bring up a cluster, then part it out, break the system, and watch it rebuild automatically.
* [Tectonic Sandbox][sandbox-tutorials] allows you to create a local Tectonic testing environment, in which you can learn about Kubernetes clusters while evaluating the power of Tectonic Console.
* [Amazon Web Services][aws-tutorials] tutorials describe using Tectonic to create clusters on AWS.
* [Microsoft Azure][azure-tutorials] tutorials describe using Tectonic to create clusters on Microsoft Azure.

Each platform tutorial walks through:

1. Platform prerequisites and preliminary setup
2. Downloading and installing Tectonic
3. Using Tectonic to deploy, scale, upgrade, and manage a simple app
